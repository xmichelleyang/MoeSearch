A basic machine learning project in which I tried to find out whether
or not a majority of popular manga's featured a woman on the cover.

I used Beautiful Soup API to scrape Crunchyroll for images
and Clarifai API on those images to classify whether or not the images
contained images of women.

I found that approximately 57% of popular mangas had a woman as the main
subject.
